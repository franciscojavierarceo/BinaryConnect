# Binary Connect

This is my working implementation of [Binary Connect ](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00363v3.pdf)

Much of this code was developed by Allison Fennichel, Michael Bisaha, and myself. The original [author's github](https://github.com/MatthieuCourbariaux/BinaryConnect/blob/lasagne/README.md) was also extremely helpful for this implementation. 

## Requirements

* Python, Numpy, Scipy
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html) (Bleeding edge version)
* [Keras](http://keras.io/#installation)  (For downloading the data)
* A fast Nvidia GPU or a large amount of patience
